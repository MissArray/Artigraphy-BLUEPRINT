### The background
Well over a decade ago, I decided to create a website to advertise my services as a copy editor and content editor. At the time, coding and CSS seemed intimidatingly mystical, so I used Kompozer, an open-source WYSIWYG editor. The result was a serviceable enough website sitting atop a skein of overbloated, machine-generated code. As for the design; well, the layout fell into place reasonably enough, but the colour scheme was idiosyncratic, rather than appropriate for the audience I wanted to attract.

Through the excellent Founders and Coders https://www.foundersandcoders.com/ course I completed in 2018, I discovered and fell in love with web design. Although this wasn't a focal part of the course, it did introduce me to the many fascinating aspects of UX design. 

Following that course, I explored every aspect of web design in greater depth and took my CSS and HTML5 skills to the next level. 

I have designed and coded the new English Finish website from scratch, repurposing the parts of the basic layout that worked well and ditching those that didn't. All colour combinations pass accessibility tests with AAA or at worst AA and I've tried to make 'fancier' features as accessible as possible.

To design the logo I used both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop; the icons are images of specific glyphs from an icon font.

### Purpose
The new English Finish website serves a double purpose: first, it advertises my services as a content editor in more modern, cleaner packaging; second, it demonstrates my love of web design, the technical skills I've been building - and which I mean to keep on building - and my ability to produce a simple but professional result.

#### Copyright
The code is open-source: any solutions that appeal are up for grabs.
The content, logo, colour scheme and all stylistic features are protected by standard copyright regulations.
