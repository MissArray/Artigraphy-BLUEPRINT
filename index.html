      </p>

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Artigraphy evolved from <a href='https://missarray.github.io/EnglishFinish_2013/'>English Finish,</a> an established provider of editorial services to professional writers, especially in the areas of the social sciences, CSR, organisation studies and film theory and practice. After nearly two decades, English Finish was regenerated as Artigraphy, an innovative provider of <a href='/editing.html'><b>editorial services</b>,</a> bespoke intensive <a href='/workshops.html' target='_blank'><b>workshops on English for Academic Purposes (EAP)</b></a> and <a href='/editing.html#writing-check-up' target='_blank'><b>writing diagnostics</b>.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        At Artigraphy we specialise in content editing, substantive language editing and English for Academic Purposes (EAP). We offer editorial support to authors in a range of disciplines &ndash; especially to non-native English speakers who choose or have to write in English and want to feel as confident about the quality of their work as when they write in their own language. But this is not all.
      </p>

      <h2>What we do differently</h2>
      <p>
        At Artigraphy we like to think out of the proverbial box. To develop our unique approach to the services we offer, we adopted and adapted some of the user-centred principles of <a href='https://theblog.adobe.com/what-is-ux-and-why-should-you-care/#ux' target='_blank'>UX design;</a> for some of the modules in our AWE (&lsquo;Academic Writing in English&rsquo;) workshops, we repurposed aspects of the <a href='https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/agile-project-management/' target='_blank'>Agile</a> methodology. We also follow the <a href='https://www.ciep.uk/' target='_blank'>Ciep</a> (&lsquo;Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading&rsquo;) Code of Practice &ndash; because &ndash; to paraphrase <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/' target='_blank'>Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen</a> &ndash; best practices are key to creating an &lsquo;exemplary&rsquo; client experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Our clients</h2>
      <p>
        Our clients include numerous researchers affiliated with established universities and institutes, such as <i>Ludwig-Maximilians University</i> (Germany), the <i>Copenhagen Business School</i> (Denmark), the <i>Institute for Mediterranean Studies</i> (Greece), the <i>Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin</i> (Germany), the <i>Rotterdam School of Management</i> (the Netherlands), the <i>German Research Center for Environmental Health</i> (Germany), the <i>University of Zurich</i> (Switzerland), <i>Lund University</i> (Sweden), the <i>Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; Montr&eacute;al</i> &ndash; the list is not exhaustive. We have also worked with film critics, literary critics, art critics, scriptwriters, the <i>Greek Film Archive</i> and the <i>Greek Film Center</i> (Greece).
      <br><br>
        We take pride in achieving 100&#37; positive feedback from our clients to date. The <a href='/testimonials.html' target='_blank'>testimonials</a> of authors we have worked with and researchers we have coached in our workshops speak for themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>Our subject areas</h2>
      <p>
        At Artigraphy we cover three broad subject areas: the humanities, general and popular science and film theory and practice. 
        <br>
        <span style='font-weight: 500'>We particularly welcome writing projects on social impact, social innovation and humanitarian initiatives.</span>
        <br><br>
        Over the years, we have edited, assessed and supported editorially several works on corporate social responsibility (CSR), behavioural economics, social anthropology, business management (theory and practice), history, psychology, psychiatry, epidemiology, art criticism, literary theory and criticism, film theory and criticism, as well as screenplays and synopses. We have also edited the content of academic websites as well as some non-fiction (self-help guides, travel guides).

          <b>Covid-19 update on workshops:</b> for obvious reasons, all workshops are suspended until further notice.
