            We&rsquo;re more than happy to provide you with a certificate stating that your work has been professionally edited.

            We can guarantee that your manuscript will not be rejected <i>on the grounds of poor English</i>, provided that you have incorporated the changes that the editor has made or suggested and you have <i>not</i> made other changes before submitting your work. However, publishers assess many different aspects of writing to decide whether to accept or reject a manuscript: e.g. the quality of a research study, the accuracy of factual arguments, the robustness of a plot.

          <p class='accordion-item-text'>
            In most cases, the editor will make numerous &lsquo;silent&rsquo; changes but will also suggest changes for you to make when you come to revise the edited draft of your work &ndash; for example, when a sentence is ambiguous or a passage might fit better elsewhere in the manuscript. In all those cases, you will be invited and encouraged to make the suggested changes.
            <br><br>
            However, if you decide to change anything that the editor or proofreader has already modified, corrected or left alone, you may inadvertently introduce new errors or problems. For that reason, it&rsquo;s not a good idea to make changes to an already edited manuscript, except for those recommended by the editor. 
            You will know exactly what you are advised to change and where, because the editor will flag up those passages for you to check.

            It depends on when you cancel and on your agreement with Artigraphy. You can find out what happens if you cancel in the terms &amp; conditions that apply to various cases. Generally:
            </p>
              <ul class='plain-list'>
                <li>
                  <span>If you have booked an editorial service and cancel well in advance of the date on which you&rsquo;ve agreed to deliver your work to Artigraphy, you will get a simple confirmation that our agreement has been cancelled. </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>If you have booked an editorial service and cancel close to the date on which you&rsquo;ve agreed to send us your manuscript, you may be asked to reimburse Artigraphy: if you think about it, when you book an affordable airline ticket, you always have to pay in advance and you rarely get any refund if you don&rsquo;t use your ticket. We don&rsquo;t ask you to pay in advance &ndash; although many freelancers do &ndash; but we do expect all clients to honour the agreement. Remember that freelance editors and coaches are on no-one&rsquo;s payroll and that when you reserve a slot, the freelancer will often turn down other offers of work to take on yours.</span>

              </span>

          <div class='accordion-item-text'>
            <p>
            Yes; generally, it is possible to transfer a slot you&rsquo;ve booked but can no longer use to another author, if the &lsquo;replacement&rsquo; manuscript is suitable in terms of length and overall difficulty and if the author you&rsquo;ve asked to take over your slot accepts the terms of the agreement you have concluded with Artigraphy. A couple of things to note:
           </p>
            <ul class='plain-list'>
              <li>
                <span>You need to let us know that a colleague would like to use your slot instead of you and to check whether this is feasible in the first place.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>If the &lsquo;replacement&rsquo; is longer than yours, the fee will be adjusted accordingly.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>If the &lsquo;replacement&rsquo; is shorter, we may not always be able to offer a lower fee, depending on when you contact us.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  If the proposed &lsquo;replacement&rsquo; is not suitable (e.g. because it is highly technical or too long for the reserved slot), we may have to turn it down. 
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>The general terms & conditions of the original agreement apply in all cases.</span>

            Editors, like translators, calculate their rates on the basis of how many words they can process per hour &ndash; on average, anywhere between 1&ndash;3 pages per hour for &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; text. Research papers and academic works more generally are almost always considered &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; for editorial purposes.
            <br>
            The exact figure depends on how well a text is written, how fluent the author and how demanding the subject matter is. In the case of substantive editing, content editing, language editing and developmental editing, in addition to those factors, the editor&rsquo;s speed also depends on the extent to which a text will need to be recast (i.e. rewritten) or restructured.

              The easiest method is by <span style='font-weight:500;'>direct bank transfer</span>: every invoice, whether in GBP or EUR, includes all necessary details.
              Alternatively, you can use a service such as <a href='https://www.currenciesdirect.com/aff/v1/mover-focus.php' target='_blank' style='font-weight:500'>Currencies Direct</a> or <a href='https://www.xe.com/xemoneytransfer/information.php ' target='_blank'style='font-weight:500'>XE Money Transfer.</a> We are not in anyway affiliated with and receive no commission from any of these companies.

            Yes, you can pay in either euro or sterling. We don&rsquo;t expect this to change because of Brexit.
